Machine Learning Experiments with Hugging Face ðŸ¤—

## What's inside

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ build.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ install.log
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ run.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ emotions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sentiment
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ summarization
â””â”€â”€ wheel
â””â”€â”€ model
```

## How to build
To build experiments run
```bash
./build.sh
```

## How to run
To run an experiment run
```bash
./run.sh [experiment_name]
```

where `experiment_name` is among the following supported experiment names:

## Experiments
The following experiments are supported
- emotions - emotions detection
- sentiment - sentiment analysis
- summarization - text summarization


## Depencendies
Dependecies are defined in the `requirements.txt` file and currently are

```bash
tensorflow==2.2.0
torch==1.5.0
transformers==3.0.2
```
These will install a number of dependant libraries that can be found in the `install.log`.

## Wheel? What's that?
I'm using install from local wheels if avaiable. This will speed up build and tests, avoding to transfer several times data over the internet:

```bash
Collecting torch==1.5.0
  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/76/58/668ffb25215b3f8231a550a227be7f905f514859c70a65ca59d28f9b7f60/torch-1.5.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl (752.0MB)
```
  
I download once the big wheels for `pytorch` (752 MB) and `tensorflow` ((516.2 MB) in the `wheel` folder and check for them before building:

```bash
â””â”€â”€ wheel
    â”œâ”€â”€ tensorflow-2.2.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl
    â””â”€â”€ torch-1.5.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
```
